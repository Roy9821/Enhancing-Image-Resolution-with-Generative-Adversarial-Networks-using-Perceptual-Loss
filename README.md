# Enhancing-Image-Resolution-with-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-using-Perceptual-Loss
This projects features a GAN-based image resolution enhancement technique using perceptual loss, beneficial for improving low-resolution images, enhancing old photos, and enabling better zoom capabilities in digital imagery.
